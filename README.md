# ProductiviMe
The clean productivity to-do list website for minimalists. ProductiviMe is built using **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**, and stores user data locally so that user's are able to track their goals even after closing the website. An **AWS S3 Bucket** was used to host the project and it can be viewed at: **http://productivime.s3-website.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/**
